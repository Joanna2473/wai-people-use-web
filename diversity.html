  <h2><a name="diversity" id="diversity" shape="rect">Diversity of abilities</a></h2>
  <p>There are many reasons why people may be experiencing varying degrees of auditory, cognitive, physical, speech, and visual disabilities. For instance, some may have disabilities from birth, an illness, disease, or accident, or they may develop impairments with age. Some may not consider themselves to have disabilities even if they do experience such functional limitations.</p>
  <h3 class="f_panelHead">More about diversity of abilities</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Each individual is unique. People have diverse abilities, skills, tools, preferences, and expectations that can impact how they use the Web. For instance, consider the following aspects:</p>
    <ul class="listspaced">
      <li><strong><a name="ageing" id="ageing" shape="rect">Age-related impairments:</a></strong> Many people develop age-related impairments. While they share the same functional requirements as others with disabilities, sometimes there are significant differences in the use of assistive technologies, the level of computer skills, or in the use of the Web in general.</li>
      <li><strong><a name="combined" id="combined" shape="rect">Multiple disabilities:</a></strong> Some people have combinations of different kinds of disabilities, which may limit their approaches for interacting with the Web. For instance, someone who is deaf and has low vision might benefit from captions for audio, but only if these captions have adjustable size and color.</li>
      <li><strong><a name="health" id="health" shape="rect">Health conditions:</a></strong> Some people have health conditions that may affect their stamina, dexterity, or concentration. For instance, some may experience fatigue, pain, or other symptoms that could have an impact on their physical use of the computer or limit the duration or extent of their use of the Web.</li>
      <li><strong><a name="changing" id="changing" shape="rect">Changing abilities:</a></strong> Some people may be experiencing progressive or recurring functional limitations that impact their use of the Web differently at different times. For instance, some may need particular accessibility features on one day, and others or none on another day, depending on their condition.</li>
      <li><strong><a name="temporary" id="temporary" shape="rect">Temporary impairments:</a></strong> Some people may be experiencing temporary impairments such as those that may occur due to an accident, surgery, or medication. They may not know about accessibility solutions, may not know how to use accessibility features, and may be unaware of their needs.</li>
      <li><strong><a name="situational" id="situational" shape="rect">Situational limitations:</a></strong> Some people may be experiencing constraints due to their surrounding or due to other situational aspects. For instance, they may be in a loud environment and unable to hear audio, in bright sunlight and unable to see a screen, or they may not be able to afford some technologies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Websites and web tools designed for people with a broad range of abilities benefit everyone, including people without disabilities. It is, therefore, important to consider the broad diversity of functional needs rather than to categorize people according to medical classifications.</p>
  </div>

  <h2><a name="auditory" id="auditory" shape="rect">Auditory</a></h2>
  <p>Auditory disabilities range from mild or moderate hearing loss in one or both ears (“hard of hearing”) to substantial and uncorrectable hearing loss in both ears (“deafness”). Some people with auditory disabilities can hear sounds but sometimes not sufficiently to understand all speech, especially when there is background noise. This can include people using hearing aids.</p>
  <h3 class="f_panelHead">More about auditory disabilities</h3>
  <div>
    <p>While multimedia on the Web provides many opportunities for people with auditory disabilities, it also poses challenges when content is not designed to be accessible. For instance, while video content can be used to communicate information visually, audio content needs to have alternatives, such as transcripts and captions, so that it is accessible for people with auditory disabilities.</p>
    <p>To use the Web effectively, people with auditory disabilities often rely on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Transcripts and captions of audio content, including audio-only content and audio tracks in multimedia;</li>
      <li>Media players that display captions and provide options to adjust the text size and colors of captions;</li>
      <li>Options to stop, pause, and adjust the volume of audio content (independently of the system volume);</li>
      <li>High-quality foreground audio that is clearly distinguishable from any background noise.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For some people with auditory disabilities, sign language is the primary language, and they may not read the written language as fluently. Providing important information in sign language and using simpler text that is supplemented by images, graphs, and other illustrations help make web content more understandable to many people. However, it is important to remember that not all people with auditory disabilities know sign language.</p>

  <h2><a name="cognitive" id="cognitive" shape="rect">Cognitive, learning, and neurological</a></h2>
  <p>Cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities involve neurodiversity and neurological disorders, as well as behavioral and mental health disorders that are not necessarily neurological. They may affect any part of the nervous system and impact how well people hear, move, see, speak, and understand information. Cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities do not necessarily affect the intelligence of a person.</p>
  <h3 class="f_panelHead">More about cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Computer technologies and the Web provide many opportunities for people with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities to interact with content and to process information in ways that are more usable to them. For instance, people can navigate web content using different strategies, access information in text, audio, or other formats, and change the presentation of the content according to their individual needs or preferences.</p>
    <p>Depending on the individual needs, people with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities often rely on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clearly structured content that facilitates overview and orientation;</li>
      <li>Consistent labeling of forms, buttons, and other content parts;</li>
      <li>Predictable link targets, functionality, and overall interaction;</li>
      <li>Different ways of navigating websites, such as hierarchical menu and search;</li>
      <li>Options to suppress blinking, flickering, flashing, and otherwise distracting content;</li>
      <li>Simpler text that is supplemented by images, graphs, and other illustrations;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>People with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities use different types of web browsing methods, depending on their particular needs. For instance, some people use text-to-speech software to hear the information while reading it visually or use captions to read the information while hearing it. Some people use tools that resize text and spacing or customize colors to assist reading. Others use grammar and spelling tools to support writing. For these web browsing methods to work, developers need to consider web accessibility requirements which are often shared by people with hearing, physical, speech, and visual disabilities.</p>

  <h2><a name="physical" id="physical" shape="rect">Physical</a></h2>
  <p>Physical disabilities (sometimes called "motor disabilities") include weakness and limitations of muscular control (such as involuntary movements including tremors, lack of coordination, or paralysis), limitations of sensation, joint disorders (such as arthritis), pain that impedes movement, and missing limbs.</p>
  <h3 class="f_panelHead">More about physical disabilities</h3>
  <div>
    <p>To use the Web, people with physical disabilities often use specialized hardware and software such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ergonomic or specially designed keyboard or mouse;</li>
      <li>Head pointer, mouth stick, and other aids to help with typing;</li>
      <li>On-screen keyboard with trackball, joysticks, or other pointing devices;</li>
      <li>Switches operated by foot, shoulder, sip-and-puff, or other movements;</li>
      <li>Voice recognition, eye tracking, and other approaches for hands-free interaction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>People with physical disabilities may be using a mouse or mouse-like device only, or keyboard or keyboard-like device only to operate the computer. People with physical disabilities rely on keyboard support to activate functionality provided on web pages. They may need more time to type, click, or carry out other interaction, and they may type single keystrokes in sequence rather than typing simultaneous keystrokes ("chording") to activate commands.  Such keystrokes include commands for special characters, shortcut keys, and to active menu items.</p>
    <p>People with physical disabilities may have trouble clicking small areas and are more likely to make mistakes in typing and clicking. Providing large clickable areas, enough time to complete tasks, and error correction options for forms are important design aspects. Other important design aspects include providing visible indicators of the current focus, and mechanisms to skip over blocks, such as over page headers or navigation bars. People with cognitive and visual disabilities share many of these requirements.</p>

  <h2><a name="speech" id="speech" shape="rect">Speech</a></h2>
  <p>Speech disabilities include difficulty producing speech that is recognizable by others or by voice recognition software. For instance, the loudness or clarity of someone's voice might be difficult to understand.</p>
  <h3 class="f_panelHead">More about speech disabilities</h3>
  <div>
    <p>People with speech disabilities encounter barriers with voice-based services, such as automated web-based hotlines and web applications that are operated using voice commands. To use services that rely on voice, people with speech disabilities need alternative modes of interaction such as a text-based chat to interact with hotline representatives and keyboard commands to operate web applications. Also, websites that provide telephone numbers as the only means of communicating with an organization pose barriers for people with speech disabilities. Alternative means of communication include e-mail and feedback forms.</p>
  </div>

  <h2><a name="visual" id="visual" shape="rect">Visual</a></h2>
  <p>Visual disabilities range from mild or moderate vision loss in one or both eyes ("low vision") to substantial and uncorrectable vision loss in both eyes ("blindness"). Some people have reduced or lack of sensitivity to certain colors ("color blindness"), or increased sensitivity to bright colors. These variations in perception of colors and brightness can be independent of the visual acuity.</p>
  <h3 class="f_panelHead">More about visual disabilities</h3>
  <div>
    <p>People with visual disabilities typically rely on changing the presentation of web content into forms that are more usable for their particular needs. For example by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enlarging or reducing text size and images;</li>
      <li>Customizing settings for fonts, colors, and spacing;</li>
      <li>Listening to text-to-speech synthesis of the content;</li>
      <li>Listening to audio descriptions of video in multimedia;</li>
      <li>Reading text using refreshable Braille.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For these web browsing methods to work, developers need to ensure that the presentation of web content is independent of its underlying structure and that the structure is correctly coded so that it can be processed and presented in different ways by web browsers and assistive technologies. For instance, some people do not see the content and rely on lists, headings, tables, and other page structures to be properly coded so that they can be identified by web browsers and assistive technologies.</p>
    <p>Some people are only seeing small portions of the content at a time or are perceiving the colors and design differently. Some people are using customized fonts, colors, and spacing to make the content more readable, or they are navigating through the content using keyboard only because they cannot see the mouse pointer. An accessible design supports different presentations of the web content and different ways of interaction.</p>
